"""Rewrite the `duckdb` resource block in a Homebrew formula to point at the
prebuilt macOS universal2 wheel for whichever duckdb version `brew
bump-formula-pr` most recently pinned as the sdist resource, instead of the
sdist tarball (which requires compiling duckdb's C++ core with cmake/ninja),
and repin the `on_linux` `duckdb-linux` blocks to that version's manylinux
x86_64/aarch64 wheels, which `brew bump-formula-pr` never rewrites.

Usage: sync_duckdb_wheel.py <path-to-formula.rb>

Exits non-zero (leaving the file untouched) if:
  - no `resource "duckdb" do ... end` block is found,
  - a duckdb version can't be parsed out of it,
  - either `duckdb-linux` block (on_intel, on_arm) is missing,
  - PyPI has no single cp314 macosx universal2, manylinux x86_64 or manylinux
    aarch64 wheel for that exact version.

A non-zero exit is intentional and fails the CI job: it leaves the tap's
formula-bump PR open and unmerged for a human to look at, rather than
silently merging a formula that can't build (see homebrew-tap.yml, where the
subsequent "Merge Homebrew formula bump PR" step only runs on success).
